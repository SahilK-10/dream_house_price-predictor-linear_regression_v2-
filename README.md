# dream_house_price-predictor-linear_regression_v2-


so basically in this project we take into account data of around 550 properties.

not only their size, but we also take into consideration the amenities they are providing
1. no. of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking spaces
2. do they have airconditioning
3. do they have water heating
4. is the property furnished, unfurnished or semi furnished

the model then learns from this data and tries to predict the price of the house that'll match our requirements.
